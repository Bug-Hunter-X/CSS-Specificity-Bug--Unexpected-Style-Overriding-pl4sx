To solve the specificity issue, we can adjust the selectors to ensure the desired styles are applied.  One approach is to make the more general selector more specific by adding more selectors to it. Another is to use the !important flag (though this is generally discouraged). In the following example, we improve the specificity of the general selector by adding an ID:  /* bug.css */ #myDiv .myClass { color: blue; } .myClass { color: red; } /* bugSolution.css */ #myDiv .myClass { color: blue; } .myClass { color: red; /* This will now be correctly overridden */ }
