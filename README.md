This repository demonstrates a common CSS bug related to specificity issues.  A more specific selector unintentionally overrides a general selector, leading to unexpected styling. The solution involves carefully adjusting selector specificity to ensure the intended styles are applied correctly.  The `bug.css` file contains the buggy code, and `bugSolution.css` shows the corrected version.
